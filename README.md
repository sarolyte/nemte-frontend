# Nemte Frontend (React + Vite)

## Introduction

Nemte is a recipe website that currently allows anyone to browse, create and edit recipes.

This is a final mobile-first Code Academy Front-End course project.

This repository contains the frontend part of the project, built with **React** and **Vite**.  

The frontend connects to a separate **Node.js + MongoDB backend** project - https://github.com/sarolyte/nemte-backend. Both must be running at the same time for the application to function properly.
